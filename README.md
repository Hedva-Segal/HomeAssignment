 - Performance: Reading data from a file is suitable for simple use cases with small datasets and low performance requirements. On the other hand, reading data from a database like Redis provides scalability, performance, advanced querying capabilities, and data persistence, making it suitable for more complex applications with larger datasets and higher performance demands.

- Pagination: Using pagination instead of loading all data from a database offers several benefits, including improved performance, reduced resource consumption, and better scalability. By fetching data in smaller batches, pagination helps optimize resource utilization, minimize network overhead, and ensure the application remains scalable and responsive, even with large datasets.
